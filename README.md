# Terminal based text editor

tedit can read and edit text files. It can be used for basic file editing like nano.  
Right now it doesn't have any key-bindings, I'll try to add some to make editing faster and more convenient.

### How to install:

```bash
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Working keys so far:

- Move around with arrow keys
- <kbd>^X</kbd> or <kbd>:q</kbd> quits the editor
- <kbd>^S</kbd> saves the file
- <kbd>^A</kbd> Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
